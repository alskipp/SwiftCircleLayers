SwiftCircleLayers
=================

This is a very simple Swift iOS demo app: tap the screen to add translucent pulsating circles.

Inspired by the following [blog post](http://www.ioscreator.com/tutorials/drawing-circles-uitouch-ios8-swift)

This demo project differs in that it uses CALayers rather than sub views and drawrect. One benefit of using CALayers is that they are incredibly easy to animate.

NOTE: Requires Swift 1.2.
